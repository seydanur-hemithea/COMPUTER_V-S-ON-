**fish_detection**
This project uses YOLOv8 to detect fish in images with bounding boxes. Built on a ready-to-use dataset from Roboflow Universe, it was trained and tested in Google Colab with fast, accurate results. Whether you're building a marine monitoring tool or just love aquatic creatures, this model is a playful and effective solution

 Dataset
- Source: Fish Detection â€“ Roboflow Universe
- Format: YOLOv8
- Classes: 1 (fish)
- Annotations: Bounding boxes included, no manual labeling required

 Features
- Fast and accurate object detection with YOLOv8
- Roboflow API integration for seamless dataset access
- Google Colab compatible training and inference
- Visual output with bounding boxes
- Simple, elegant, and aquatic


**object_detection_retinanet**: is a RetinaNet-powered object detection project that identifies and locates airborne objects such as airplanes, helicopters, drones, and birds in diverse sky conditions. Built with a narrative-driven approach, this project transforms technical modeling into a visual performance.

This project implements RetinaNet without relying on external libraries like Fizyr. All components are built directly using PyTorch and torchvision.


Rather than importing pre-built RetinaNet from Fizyr, this project builds the model layer by layer, treating each component as a scene in a technical performance
